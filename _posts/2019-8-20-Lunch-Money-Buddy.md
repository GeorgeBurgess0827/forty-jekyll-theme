Course: Interaction Design

<h3>Problem</h3>
For this project, I was given seven weeks to created a mobile app called “Lunch Money Buddy.” The app allows parents and guardians of school age children to manage various aspects of their kids’ in-school cafeteria lunch accounts. 

The app allows parents and guardians to do the following things: 
<ul>
  <li>Download and sign up.</li> 
  <li>Add funds the account.</li>  
  <li>View account balance.</li>  
  <li>View school lunch menu by child.</li>  
  <li>View subsidy status.</li>  
  <li>Add a lunch to a list of favorites.</li>  
  <li>Close account.</li> 
</ul>
  
<h3>Actions</h3>
User personas as well as application specifications were provided as a starting point for this assignment. From there I created user journeys for the provided personas as well as a sitemap for the application. Next I began to sketch out wireframes for Lunch Money Buddy on paper based of my user journeys and sitemap. After sketching I recreated my wireframes digitally using a wire-framing tool called Balsamiq. Then I moved my design to proto.io which is a prototyping tool. Here I made my wireframes interactive. Including navigation, gesture controls, and finalized all interactions and micro interactions. Finally, I added example content to prepare for usability testing.

<h3>Results</h3>
Below are some screenshots of the deliverables created as well as a link to the prototype.
