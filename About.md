My ambition is to one day become proficient at both Front-End Development
as well as UX Design. With the combination of these two skill sets I will be able to
design and build anything I want! But more realistically, I would be the perfect liaison
between designers and developers.

I completed my master's degree in UX design in August of 2017. I would like to
transition into a UX/UI designer role to better reinforce my studies and gain
valuable real-world experience.
