Lunch Money Buddy
​Course: Interaction Design
​Type: Mobile Application Design
Tools: Paper, Balsamiq, Proto.io
Role: Interaction Designer
Problem
For this project, I was given seven weeks to created a mobile app called “Lunch Money Buddy.” The app allows parents and guardians of school age children to manage various aspects of their kids’ in-school cafeteria lunch accounts. 

The app allows parents and guardians to do the following things: 
• Download and sign up. 
• Add funds the account. 
• View account balance. 
• View school lunch menu by child. 
• View subsidy status. 
• Add a lunch to a list of favorites. 
• Close account.
Actions
User personas as well as application specifications were provided as a starting point for this assignment. From there I created user journeys for the provided personas as well as a sitemap for the application. Next I began to sketch out wireframes for Lunch Money Buddy on paper based of my user journeys and sitemap. After sketching I recreated my wireframes digitally using a wire-framing tool called Balsamiq. Then I moved my design to proto.io which is a prototyping tool. Here I made my wireframes interactive. Including navigation, gesture controls, and finalized all interactions and micro interactions. Finally, I added example content to prepare for usability testing.
Results
Below are some screenshots of the deliverables created as well as a link to the prototype.
